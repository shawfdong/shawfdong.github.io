I've recently designed and built a Visualization Wall for UCSC library.<!-- more -->

## Hardware
* A 4U Tower Server (assembled by [Advanced HPC](https://www.advancedhpc.com/)), with
  * Two 8-core [Intel Xeon E5-2630 v4](https://ark.intel.com/products/92981/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2630-v4-25M-Cache-2_20-GHz) processors @ 2.2 GHz
  * Three [Nvidia Quadro P4000](http://www.pny.com/nvidia-quadro-p4000) Graphics Cards, each with 8GB GDDR5
  * 128GB DDR4 ECC/REG memory (8 x 16GB)
  * Two 1TB Samsung 850 Pro Series SSDs
  * Two 8TB SATA 7200RPM Drives
  * Intel X540 Single Port 10GbE RJ45 NIC
* Eight [46" HD Planar LCD Monitors](http://www.planar.com/products/lcd-video-walls/clarity-matrix-lcd/mx/) (Model: MX46HDX) with 1.7mm bezel

## Software
* **Hostname**: lib-dsc-vizw1.ucsc.edu;
* **Windows 10**: base OS;
* [Nvidia Mosaic](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/solutions/nvidia-mosaic-technology/): the technology to turn the 8 HD monitors into a single unified desktop environment
  * [NVIDIA Mosaic Technology User's Guide](http://images.nvidia.com/content/quadro/product-literature/user-guides/NVMosaic-UG.pdf)
  * NV Mosaic would work even better if we could add a [Quadro Sync II](http://www.nvidia.com/object/quadro-sync.html) card
* [Sage2](http://sage2.sagecommons.org/)
  * [Sage2 Installation documentation](http://sage2.sagecommons.org/download/2251/)
  * [Sage2 Wiki](http://bitbucket.org/sage2/sage2/wiki)
