title: Pulpos - A Ceph Storage for SciDMZ
tags: [Ceph, Storage]
---

My first ITS project was to deploy a pilot Ceph Storage for Data Transfer and Data Warehousing in SciDMZ.<!-- more -->

## Etymology
The name **Ceph** is a common nickname given to pet octopuses and derives from cephalopods. It is only befitting that we christen our Ceph storage **Pulpos**, which is the Spanish word for octopuses, as UCSC is a Hispanic Serving Institution member of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities. In recent years, Hispanic/Latino enrollment at UCSC has been more than 30 percent.

## Objectives
The objectives of this projects were:
* To deploy a Ceph storage with an initial raw capacity of at least 200TB (resulting in a usable capacity of about 100TB if we use a replication size of 2), including the following components:
  * One admin node
  * One monitor node
  * One metadata server
  * One data-transfer node
  * Three OSD (Object Storage Daemon) servers
  * One GE switch for internal management traffic
  * One 10GE switch for OSD replication and heartbeat traffic
* To create a replicated pool with size 2 (that is, 2 copies of each object will be stored), in order to ensure resilience and high performance of the system
* To design a scalable storage platform, amenable to future expansion
* To rapidly transfer large amount of data between UCSC and other research institutions
* To set up a distributed Ceph testbed among UCSC, UCSD, Caltech and potentially other [PRP](http://prp.ucsd.edu/) members
* To tune up the storage and network stacks in order to utilize the system at maximum efficiency
* To measure and benchmark the performance of the system
* To explore and evaluate the usage of Ceph as a scratch file system for HPC and a possible replacement for parallel file systems like Lustre and GPFS
* To explore and evaluate the usage of Ceph as a storage platform for SCIPP ATLAS cluster
* To explore and evaluate the usage of Ceph as a data warehousing platform for Data Science / Machine Learning applications
* To compile detailed documentations, and to share our experiences and lessons with the community
