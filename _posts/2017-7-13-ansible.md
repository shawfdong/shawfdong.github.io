We use [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to configure our Ceph storage cluster [Pulpos]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-2-9-pulpos %}).<!-- more --> While there are many popular configuration management systems available for Linux systems, such as Chef and Puppet, Ansible is a great alternative to these options because it has a much smaller overhead. Ansible does not require any additional software to be installed on the client computers. It communicates over normal SSH channels in order to retrieve information from remote machines, issue commands, and copy files (Ref: [How to Install and Configure Ansible on CentOS 7](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-centos-7)).

## Installing Ansible
Ansible package is available from the EPEL repository. To install Ansible on the admin node [pulpos-admin]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-7-10-pulpo-admin %}):
{% highlight shell_session %}
[root@pulpo-admin ~]# yum -y install ansible
{% endhighlight %}

## Configuring Ansible hosts
Create a simple Ansible hosts file `/etc/ansible/hosts` that contains all the nodes in the Pulpos cluster:
{% highlight ini %}
## Pulpos
[dtn]
pulpo-dtn.local

[mons]
pulpo-mon01.local
pulpo-mds01.local
pulpo-admin.local

[pulpo:children]
dtn
mons

[osds]
pulpo-osd[01:03].local
{% endhighlight %}

## Testing Ansible
**Note**: Ansible looks for an `ansible.cfg` file in the following places, in this order:
* File specified by the `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` environment variable
* `./ansible.cfg` (ansible.cfg in the current directory)
* `~/.ansible.cfg` (.ansible.cfg in your home directory)
* `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`

Let's perform a simple ping test to all the nodes:
{% highlight shell_session %}
[root@pulpo-admin ~]# ansible -v -m ping all
[root@pulpo-admin ~]# ansible -v -m ping all
Using /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg as config file
pulpo-osd01.local | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
pulpo-mon01.local | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
pulpo-mds01.local | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
pulpo-dtn.local | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
pulpo-admin.local | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
pulpo-osd02.local | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
pulpo-osd03.local | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
{% endhighlight %}
