title: Supermicro IPMI Vulnerability
tags: [Security]

There is a major security vulnerability for Supermicro servers with *factory default* [IPMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface) settings!<!-- more -->  Three *factory default* settings contribute to the vulnerability, which potentially makes numerous Supermicro servers susceptible to remote control by malicious parties.

1) The *factory default* option for the IPMI interface is **failover**. For example, on the 4-GPU workstation [Hydra]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-7-28-hydra %}), there are two dedicated LAN interfaces for the operating system (LAN1/2) and one dedicated LAN interface for IPMI. There are 3 options for the IPMI interface:
* **Dedicated**: Always use the dedicated IPMI interface.
* **Shared**: Always use the LAN1 interface.
* **Failover (factory default)**: On boot, detect if the dedicated IPMI interface is connected. If so, use the dedicated interface, otherwise fall back to the shared LAN1.

2) The *factory default* behavior is for the IPMI device to acquire an IP address via DHCP.

3) The *default* ADMINISTRATOR username for On Supermicro Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) is **ADMIN**, and its default password is **ADMIN**.

So let's assume that you've just bought a fancy Supermicro server or workstation, such as our 4-GPU workstation [Hydra]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-7-28-hydra %}); you don't plan to use, or even know anything about, IPMI. You simply plug a network cable to LAN1 to connect it to the internet, which you need to run the OS. Unbeknownst to you, IPMI interface will fail over to LAN1; and it will try to acquire an IP address via DHCP. More often than not, the IPMI interface will get a public routable IP address, with you being none the wiser! Then if an evil-doer knows the IP address for your IPMI interface &mdash; it is trivial to scan for such vulnerability &mdash; he can use the default ADMINISTRATOR username and password to remotely control your fancy computer!
