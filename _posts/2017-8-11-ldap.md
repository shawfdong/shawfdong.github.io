UCSC runs [two directory services](https://github.com/shawfdong/hyades/wiki/Authentication-via-LDAP): **Blue** & **Gold**, on *ldap-blue.ucsc.edu* & *ldap-gold.ucsc.edu* respectively.<!-- more --> The *Blue* directory service carries a lot of baggage. For example, here is my LDAP entry:
{% highlight shell_session %}
dn: uid=shaw,ou=people,dc=ucsc,dc=edu
cn: Shawfeng Dong
homeDirectory: /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/users/t/shaw
loginShell: /usr/bin/bash
objectClass: posixAccount
uid: shaw
uidNumber: 16348
gidNumber: 100000
{% endhighlight %}
Particularly glaring is the attribute for *homeDirectory*: **/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/users/t/shaw**, which harkens back to the old happy days when AFS was popular and widely deployed! To use this *legacy* directory service for authentication on modern Linux, we need to map / overwrite the attributes, especially the *homeDirectory* attribute.

Fortunately, solutions are easy and varied.

1) I wrote an article in 2014, describing how to [use an init shell script to overwrite](https://github.com/shawfdong/hyades/wiki/Authentication-via-LDAP) the *homeDirectory* attribute and automatically create home directories.

2) If you use *nss-pam-ldapd*, you can [use nslcd to map attributes](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/directory/pam/local-home). Add the following to `/etc/nslcd.conf`:
{% highlight conf %}
map passwd gidNumber uidNumber
map passwd homeDirectory "/home/$uid"
{% endhighlight %}

3) If you use SSSD, you can [use the override_homedir option](https://jhrozek.fedorapeople.org/sssd/git/man/sssd-ad.5.html). Add the following to `/etc/sssd/sssd/conf`:
{% highlight conf %}
override_homedir = /home/%u
{% endhighlight %}
